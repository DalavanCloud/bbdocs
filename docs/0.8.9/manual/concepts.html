<h1>Concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#concepts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This chapter defines some of the basic concepts that the Buildbot
uses. You'll need to understand how the Buildbot sees the world to
configure it properly.</p>
<div class="section" id="source-stamps">
<span id="id1"></span><h2>Source Stamps<a class="headerlink" href="#source-stamps" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Source code comes from <em>repositories</em>, provided by version control systems.
Repositories are generally identified by URLs, e.g., <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git://github.com/buildbot/buildbot.git</span></tt>.</p>
<p>In these days of distributed version control systems, the same <em>codebase</em> may appear in multiple repositories.
For example, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-central</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-release</span></tt> both contain the Firefox codebase, although not exactly the same code.</p>
<p>Many <em>projects</em> are built from multiple codebases.
For example, a company may build several applications based on the same core library.
The &quot;app&quot; codebase and the &quot;core&quot; codebase are in separate repositories, but are compiled together and constitute a single project.
Changes to either codebase should cause a rebuild of the application.</p>
<p>Most version control systems define some sort of <em>revision</em> that can be used (sometimes in combination with a <em>branch</em>) to uniquely specify a particular version of the source code.</p>
<p>To build a project, Buildbot needs to know exactly which version of each codebase it should build.
It uses a <em>source stamp</em> to do so for each codebase; the collection of sourcestamps required for a project is called a <em>source stamp set</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-control-systems">
<span id="id2"></span><h2>Version Control Systems<a class="headerlink" href="#version-control-systems" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Buildbot supports a significant number of version control systems, so it treats them abstractly.</p>
<p>For purposes of deciding when to perform builds, Buildbot's change sources monitor repositories, and represent any updates to those repositories as <em>changes</em>.
These change sources fall broadly into two categories: pollers which periodically check the repository for updates; and hooks, where the repository is configured to notify Buildbot whenever an update occurs.</p>
<p>This concept does not map perfectly to every version control system.
For example, for CVS Buildbot must guess that version updates made to multiple files within a short time represent a single change; for DVCS's like Git, Buildbot records a change when a commit is pushed to the monitored repository, not when it is initially committed.
We assume that the <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Change</span></tt>s arrive at the master in the same order in which they are committed to the repository.</p>
<p>When it comes time to actually perform a build, a scheduler prepares a source stamp set, as described above, based on its configuration.
When the build begins, one or more source steps use the information in the source stamp set to actually check out the source code, using the normal VCS commands.</p>
<div class="section" id="tree-stability">
<h3>Tree Stability<a class="headerlink" href="#tree-stability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Changes tend to arrive at a buildmaster in bursts.
In many cases, these bursts of changes are meant to be taken together.
For example, a developer may have pushed multiple commits to a DVCS that comprise the same new feature or bugfix.
To avoid trying to build every change, Buildbot supports the notion of <em>tree stability</em>, by waiting for a burst of changes to finish before starting to schedule builds.
This is implemented as a timer, with builds not scheduled until no changes have occurred for the duration of the timer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-different-vc-systems-specify-sources">
<span id="id3"></span><h3>How Different VC Systems Specify Sources<a class="headerlink" href="#how-different-vc-systems-specify-sources" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For CVS, the static specifications are <em>repository</em> and
<em>module</em>. In addition to those, each build uses a timestamp (or
omits the timestamp to mean <em>the latest</em>) and <em>branch tag</em>
(which defaults to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">HEAD</span></tt>). These parameters collectively specify a set
of sources from which a build may be performed.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a>,  combines the
repository, module, and branch into a single <em>Subversion URL</em>
parameter. Within that scope, source checkouts can be specified by a
numeric <em>revision number</em> (a repository-wide
monotonically-increasing marker, such that each transaction that
changes the repository is indexed by a different revision number), or
a revision timestamp. When branches are used, the repository and
module form a static <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">baseURL</span></tt>, while each build has a
<em>revision number</em> and a <em>branch</em> (which defaults to a
statically-specified <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">defaultBranch</span></tt>). The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">baseURL</span></tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">branch</span></tt> are simply concatenated together to derive the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">svnurl</span></tt> to use for the checkout.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.perforce.com/">Perforce</a> is similar. The server
is specified through a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">P4PORT</span></tt> parameter. Module and branch
are specified in a single depot path, and revisions are
depot-wide. When branches are used, the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">p4base</span></tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">defaultBranch</span></tt> are concatenated together to produce the depot
path.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://bazaar-vcs.org">Bzr</a> (which is a descendant of
Arch/Bazaar, and is frequently referred to as &quot;Bazaar&quot;) has the same
sort of repository-vs-workspace model as Arch, but the repository data
can either be stored inside the working directory or kept elsewhere
(either on the same machine or on an entirely different machine). For
the purposes of Buildbot (which never commits changes), the repository
is specified with a URL and a revision number.</p>
<p>The most common way to obtain read-only access to a bzr tree is via
HTTP, simply by making the repository visible through a web server
like Apache. Bzr can also use FTP and SFTP servers, if the buildslave
process has sufficient privileges to access them. Higher performance
can be obtained by running a special Bazaar-specific server. None of
these matter to the buildbot: the repository URL just has to match the
kind of server being used. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">repoURL</span></tt> argument provides the
location of the repository.</p>
<p>Branches are expressed as subdirectories of the main central
repository, which means that if branches are being used, the BZR step
is given a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">baseURL</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">defaultBranch</span></tt> instead of getting
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">repoURL</span></tt> argument.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://darcs.net/">Darcs</a> doesn't really have the
notion of a single master repository. Nor does it really have
branches. In Darcs, each working directory is also a repository, and
there are operations to push and pull patches from one of these
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">repositories</span></tt> to another. For the Buildbot's purposes, all you
need to do is specify the URL of a repository that you want to build
from. The build slave will then pull the latest patches from that
repository and build them. Multiple branches are implemented by using
multiple repositories (possibly living on the same server).</p>
<p>Builders which use Darcs therefore have a static <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">repourl</span></tt> which
specifies the location of the repository. If branches are being used,
the source Step is instead configured with a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">baseURL</span></tt> and a
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">defaultBranch</span></tt>, and the two strings are simply concatenated
together to obtain the repository's URL. Each build then has a
specific branch which replaces <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">defaultBranch</span></tt>, or just uses the
default one. Instead of a revision number, each build can have a
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">context</span></tt>, which is a string that records all the patches that are
present in a given tree (this is the output of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">darcs</span> <span class="pre">changes</span>
<span class="pre">--context</span></tt>, and is considerably less concise than, e.g. Subversion's
revision number, but the patch-reordering flexibility of Darcs makes
it impossible to provide a shorter useful specification).</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://selenic.com/mercurial">Mercurial</a> is like Darcs, in that
each branch is stored in a separate repository. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">repourl</span></tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">baseURL</span></tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">defaultBranch</span></tt> arguments are all handled the
same way as with Darcs. The <em>revision</em>, however, is the hash
identifier returned by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hg</span> <span class="pre">identify</span></tt>.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a> also follows a decentralized model, and
each repository can have several branches and tags. The source Step is
configured with a static <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">repourl</span></tt> which specifies the location
of the repository. In addition, an optional <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">branch</span></tt> parameter
can be specified to check out code from a specific branch instead of
the default <em>master</em> branch. The <em>revision</em> is specified as a SHA1
hash as returned by e.g. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">rev-parse</span></tt>. No attempt is made
to ensure that the specified revision is actually a subset of the
specified branch.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.monotone.ca/">Monotone</a> is another that follows a
decentralized model where each repository can have several branches and
tags. The source Step is configured with static <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">repourl</span></tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">branch</span></tt> parameters, which specifies the location of the
repository and the branch to use.  The <em>revision</em> is specified as a
SHA1 hash as returned by e.g. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mtn</span> <span class="pre">automate</span> <span class="pre">select</span> <span class="pre">w:</span></tt>. No
attempt is made to ensure that the specified revision is actually a
subset of the specified branch.</p>

<p>Each <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Change</span></tt> has a <tt class="xref py py-attr docutils literal"><span class="pre">who</span></tt> attribute, which specifies which developer is
responsible for the change. This is a string which comes from a namespace
controlled by the VC repository. Frequently this means it is a username on the
host which runs the repository, but not all VC systems require this.  Each
<tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">StatusNotifier</span></tt> will map the <tt class="xref py py-attr docutils literal"><span class="pre">who</span></tt> attribute into something appropriate for
their particular means of communication: an email address, an IRC handle, etc.</p>
<p>This <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">who</span></tt> attribute is also parsed and stored into Buildbot's database (see
<a class="reference internal" href="#user-objects"><em>User Objects</em></a>). Currently, only <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">who</span></tt> attributes in Changes from
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></tt> repositories are translated into user objects, but in the future all

<p>It also has a list of <tt class="xref py py-attr docutils literal"><span class="pre">files</span></tt>, which are just the tree-relative
filenames of any files that were added, deleted, or modified for this
<tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Change</span></tt>. These filenames are used by the <tt class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">fileIsImportant</span></tt>
function (in the <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Scheduler</span></tt>) to decide whether it is worth triggering a

<p>Certain <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">BuildStep</span></tt>s can also use the list of changed files
to run a more targeted series of tests, e.g. the

provide coverage for the modified .py files instead of running the

</div>
<div class="section" id="comments">
<span id="attr-comments"></span><h3>Comments<a class="headerlink" href="#comments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

</div>
<div class="section" id="project">
<span id="attr-project"></span><h3>Project<a class="headerlink" href="#project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <tt class="xref py py-attr docutils literal"><span class="pre">project</span></tt> attribute of a change or source stamp describes the project to which it corresponds, as a short human-readable string.
This is useful in cases where multiple independent projects are built on the same buildmaster.
In such cases, it can be used to control which builds are scheduled for a given commit, and to limit status displays to only one project.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="repository">
<span id="attr-repository"></span><h3>Repository<a class="headerlink" href="#repository" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This attribute specifies the repository in which this change occurred.
In the case of DVCS's, this information may be required to check out the committed source code.
However, using the repository from a change has security risks: if Buildbot is configured to blindly trust this information, then it may easily be tricked into building arbitrary source code, potentially compromising the buildslaves and the integrity of subsequent builds.</p>

<h3>Branches<a class="headerlink" href="#branches" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Change might also have a <tt class="xref py py-attr docutils literal"><span class="pre">branch</span></tt> attribute. This indicates
that all of the Change's files are in the same named branch. The
Schedulers get to decide whether the branch should be built or not.</p>
<p>For VC systems like CVS,  Git and Monotone the <tt class="xref py py-attr docutils literal"><span class="pre">branch</span></tt>
name is unrelated to the filename. (that is, the branch name and the
filename inhabit unrelated namespaces). For SVN, branches are
expressed as subdirectories of the repository, so the file's
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">svnurl</span></tt> is a combination of some base URL, the branch name, and the
filename within the branch. (In a sense, the branch name and the
filename inhabit the same namespace). Darcs branches are
subdirectories of a base URL just like SVN. Mercurial branches are the
same as Darcs.</p>

<span id="id4"></span><h2>Scheduling Builds<a class="headerlink" href="#scheduling-builds" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Each Buildmaster has a set of <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Scheduler</span></tt> objects, each of which
gets a copy of every incoming <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Change</span></tt>. The Schedulers are responsible
for deciding when <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Build</span></tt>s should be run. Some Buildbot installations
might have a single <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Scheduler</span></tt>, while others may have several, each for
a different purpose.</p>
<p>For example, a <em>quick</em> scheduler might exist to give immediate
feedback to developers, hoping to catch obvious problems in the code
that can be detected quickly. These typically do not run the full test
suite, nor do they run on a wide variety of platforms. They also
usually do a VC update rather than performing a brand-new checkout
each time.</p>
<p>A separate <em>full</em> scheduler might run more comprehensive tests, to
catch more subtle problems. configured to run after the quick scheduler, to give
developers time to commit fixes to bugs caught by the quick scheduler before
running the comprehensive tests.  This scheduler would also feed multiple
<tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Builder</span></tt>s.</p>
<p>Many schedulers can be configured to wait a while after seeing a source-code
change - this is the <em>tree stable timer</em>.  The timer allows multiple commits to
be &quot;batched&quot; together.  This is particularly useful in distributed version
control systems, where a developer may push a long sequence of changes all at
once.  To save resources, it's often desirable only to test the most recent
change.</p>
<p>Schedulers can also filter out the changes they are interested in, based on a
number of criteria.  For example, a scheduler that only builds documentation
might skip any changes that do not affect the documentation.  Schedulers can
also filter on the branch to which a commit was made.</p>
<p>There is some support for configuring dependencies between builds - for
example, you may want to build packages only for revisions which pass all of
the unit tests.  This support is under active development in Buildbot, and is
referred to as &quot;build coordination&quot;.</p>
<p>Periodic builds (those which are run every N seconds rather than after
new Changes arrive) are triggered by a special <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Periodic</span></tt>
Scheduler subclass.</p>
<p>Each Scheduler creates and submits <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">BuildSet</span></tt> objects to the
<tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">BuildMaster</span></tt>, which is then responsible for making sure the

<p>A <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">BuildSet</span></tt> is the name given to a set of <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Build</span></tt>s that all
compile/test the same version of the tree on multiple <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Builder</span></tt>s. In
general, all these component <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Build</span></tt>s will perform the same sequence of
<tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Step</span></tt>s, using the same source code, but on different platforms or
against a different set of libraries.</p>
<p>The <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">BuildSet</span></tt> is tracked as a single unit, which fails if any of
the component <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Build</span></tt>s have failed, and therefore can succeed only if
<em>all</em> of the component <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Build</span></tt>s have succeeded. There are two kinds
of status notification messages that can be emitted for a <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">BuildSet</span></tt>:
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">firstFailure</span></tt> type (which fires as soon as we know the
<tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">BuildSet</span></tt> will fail), and the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Finished</span></tt> type (which fires once
the <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">BuildSet</span></tt> has completely finished, regardless of whether the
overall set passed or failed).</p>
<p>A <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">BuildSet</span></tt> is created with set of one or more <em>source stamp</em> tuples of
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">(branch,</span> <span class="pre">revision,</span> <span class="pre">changes,</span> <span class="pre">patch)</span></tt>, some of which may be <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">None</span></tt>, and a
list of <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Builder</span></tt>s on which it is to be run. They are then given to the
BuildMaster, which is responsible for creating a separate
<tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">BuildRequest</span></tt> for each <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Builder</span></tt>.</p>
<p>There are a couple of different likely values for the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SourceStamp</span></tt>:</p>
<dl class="docutils">

<dd>This is a <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">SourceStamp</span></tt> used when a series of <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Change</span></tt>s have
triggered a build. The VC step will attempt to check out a tree that
contains <em>CHANGES</em> (and any changes that occurred before <em>CHANGES</em>, but
not any that occurred after them.)</dd>
<dt><tt class="samp docutils literal"><span class="pre">(revision=None,</span> <span class="pre">changes=None,</span> <span class="pre">patch=None)</span></tt></dt>
<dd>This builds the most recent code on the default branch. This is the
sort of <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">SourceStamp</span></tt> that would be used on a <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Build</span></tt> that was
triggered by a user request, or a <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Periodic</span></tt> scheduler. It is also
possible to configure the VC Source Step to always check out the
latest sources rather than paying attention to the <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Change</span></tt>s in the
<tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">SourceStamp</span></tt>, which will result in same behavior as this.</dd>

<dd>This builds the most recent code on the given <em>BRANCH</em>. Again, this is

<dd>This checks out the tree at the given revision <em>REV</em>, then applies a

builder working directory. The <a class="reference internal" href="cmdline.html#cmdline-try" title="try"><tt class="xref bb bb-cmdline docutils literal"><span class="pre">try</span></tt></a> command creates this kind of
<tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">SourceStamp</span></tt>. If <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">patch</span></tt> is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">None</span></tt>, the patching step is
bypassed.</dd>

<p>The buildmaster is responsible for turning the <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">BuildSet</span></tt> into a

<div class="section" id="buildrequests">
<span id="buildrequest"></span><h2>BuildRequests<a class="headerlink" href="#buildrequests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">BuildRequest</span></tt> is a request to build a specific set of source
code (specified by one ore more source stamps) on a single <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Builder</span></tt>.
Each <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Builder</span></tt> runs the <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">BuildRequest</span></tt> as soon as it can (i.e.
when an associated buildslave becomes free). <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">BuildRequest</span></tt>s are
prioritized from oldest to newest, so when a buildslave becomes free, the
<tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Builder</span></tt> with the oldest <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">BuildRequest</span></tt> is run.</p>
<p>The <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">BuildRequest</span></tt> contains one <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">SourceStamp</span></tt> specification per codebase.
The actual process of running the build (the series of <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Step</span></tt>s that will
be executed) is implemented by the <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Build</span></tt> object. In the future
this might be changed, to have the <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Build</span></tt> define <em>what</em>
gets built, and a separate <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">BuildProcess</span></tt> (provided by the
Builder) to define <em>how</em> it gets built.</p>
<p>The <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">BuildRequest</span></tt> may be mergeable with other compatible
<tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">BuildRequest</span></tt>s. Builds that are triggered by incoming <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Change</span></tt>s
will generally be mergeable. Builds that are triggered by user requests are generally not,
unless they are multiple requests to build the <em>latest sources</em> of the same branch.
A merge of buildrequests is performed per codebase, thus on changes having the same codebase.</p>

<div class="section" id="builders">
<span id="builder"></span><h2>Builders<a class="headerlink" href="#builders" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Buildmaster runs a collection of <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Builder</span></tt>s, each of which handles a single
type of build (e.g. full versus quick), on one or more build slaves.   <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Builder</span></tt>s
serve as a kind of queue for a particular type of build.  Each <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Builder</span></tt> gets a
separate column in the waterfall display. In general, each <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Builder</span></tt> runs
independently (although various kinds of interlocks can cause one <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Builder</span></tt> to
have an effect on another).</p>
<p>Each builder is a long-lived object which controls a sequence of <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Build</span></tt>s.
Each <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Builder</span></tt> is created when the config file is first parsed, and lives forever
(or rather until it is removed from the config file). It mediates the
connections to the buildslaves that do all the work, and is responsible for
creating the <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Build</span></tt> objects - <a class="reference internal" href="#concepts-build"><em>Builds</em></a>.</p>
<p>Each builder gets a unique name, and the path name of a directory where it gets
to do all its work (there is a buildmaster-side directory for keeping status
information, as well as a buildslave-side directory where the actual
checkout/compile/test commands are executed).</p>

<div class="section" id="build-factories">
<span id="concepts-build-factories"></span><h2>Build Factories<a class="headerlink" href="#build-factories" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A builder also has a <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">BuildFactory</span></tt>, which is responsible for creating new <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Build</span></tt>
instances: because the <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Build</span></tt> instance is what actually performs each build,
choosing the <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">BuildFactory</span></tt> is the way to specify what happens each time a build
is done (<a class="reference internal" href="#concepts-build"><em>Builds</em></a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="build-slaves">
<span id="concepts-build-slaves"></span><h2>Build Slaves<a class="headerlink" href="#build-slaves" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Each builder is associated with one of more <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">BuildSlave</span></tt>s.  A builder which is
used to perform Mac OS X builds (as opposed to Linux or Solaris builds) should
naturally be associated with a Mac buildslave.</p>
<p>If multiple buildslaves are available for any given builder, you will
have some measure of redundancy: in case one slave goes offline, the
others can still keep the <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Builder</span></tt> working. In addition, multiple
buildslaves will allow multiple simultaneous builds for the same
<tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Builder</span></tt>, which might be useful if you have a lot of forced or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">try</span></tt>
builds taking place.</p>
<p>If you use this feature, it is important to make sure that the
buildslaves are all, in fact, capable of running the given build. The
slave hosts should be configured similarly, otherwise you will spend a
lot of time trying (unsuccessfully) to reproduce a failure that only
occurs on some of the buildslaves and not the others. Different
platforms, operating systems, versions of major programs or libraries,
all these things mean you should use separate Builders.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="builds">
<span id="concepts-build"></span><h2>Builds<a class="headerlink" href="#builds" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A build is a single compile or test run of a particular version of the source
code, and is comprised of a series of steps.  It is ultimately up to you what
constitutes a build, but for compiled software it is generally the checkout,
configure, make, and make check sequence.  For interpreted projects like Python
modules, a build is generally a checkout followed by an invocation of the
bundled test suite.</p>
<p>A <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">BuildFactory</span></tt> describes the steps a build will perform.  The builder which
starts a build uses its configured build factory to determine the build's
steps.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="users">
<span id="concepts-users"></span><h2>Users<a class="headerlink" href="#users" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Buildbot has a somewhat limited awareness of <em>users</em>. It assumes
the world consists of a set of developers, each of whom can be
described by a couple of simple attributes. These developers make
changes to the source code, causing builds which may succeed or fail.</p>
<p>Users also may have different levels of authorization when issuing Buildbot
commands, such as forcing a build from the web interface or from an IRC channel
(see <a class="reference internal" href="cfg-statustargets.html#status-WebStatus" title="WebStatus"><tt class="xref bb bb-status docutils literal"><span class="pre">WebStatus</span></tt></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="cfg-statustargets.html#status-IRC" title="IRC"><tt class="xref bb bb-status docutils literal"><span class="pre">IRC</span></tt></a>).</p>
<p>Each developer is primarily known through the source control system. Each
<tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Change</span></tt> object that arrives is tagged with a <tt class="xref py py-attr docutils literal"><span class="pre">who</span></tt> field that
typically gives the account name (on the repository machine) of the user
responsible for that change. This string is displayed on the HTML status
pages and in each <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Build</span></tt>'s <em>blamelist</em>.</p>
<p>To do more with the User than just refer to them, this username needs to be
mapped into an address of some sort. The responsibility for this mapping is
left up to the status module which needs the address.  In the future, the
responsibility for managing users will be transferred to User Objects.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">who</span></tt> fields in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></tt> Changes are used to create <a class="reference internal" href="#user-objects"><em>User Objects</em></a>,
which allows for more control and flexibility in how Buildbot manages users.</p>
<div class="section" id="user-objects">

<p>Incoming Changes all have a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">who</span></tt> attribute attached to them that specifies
which developer is responsible for that Change. When a Change is first

<span id="id7"></span><h3>Doing Things With Users<a class="headerlink" href="#doing-things-with-users" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each change has a single user who is responsible for it. Most builds have a set
of changes: the build generally represents the first time these changes have
been built and tested by the Buildbot. The build has a <em>blamelist</em> that is
the union of the users responsible for all the build's changes. If the build
was created by a <a class="reference internal" href="cfg-schedulers.html#try-schedulers"><em>Try Schedulers</em></a> this list will include the submitter of the try
job, if known.</p>
<p>The build provides a list of users who are interested in the build -- the
<em>interested users</em>. Usually this is equal to the blamelist, but may also be
expanded, e.g., to include the current build sherrif or a module's maintainer.</p>
<p>If desired, the buildbot can notify the interested users until the problem is
resolved.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="email-addresses">
<span id="id8"></span><h3>Email Addresses<a class="headerlink" href="#email-addresses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="cfg-statustargets.html#status-MailNotifier" title="MailNotifier"><tt class="xref bb bb-status docutils literal"><span class="pre">MailNotifier</span></tt></a> is a status target which can send email
about the results of each build. It accepts a static list of email
addresses to which each message should be delivered, but it can also
be configured to send mail to the <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Build</span></tt>'s Interested Users. To do
this, it needs a way to convert User names into email addresses.</p>
<p>For many VC systems, the User Name is actually an account name on the
system which hosts the repository. As such, turning the name into an
email address is a simple matter of appending
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;repositoryhost.com</span></tt>. Some projects use other kinds of mappings
(for example the preferred email address may be at <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">project.org</span></tt>
despite the repository host being named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cvs.project.org</span></tt>), and some
VC systems have full separation between the concept of a user and that
of an account on the repository host (like Perforce). Some systems
(like Git) put a full contact email address in every change.</p>
<p>To convert these names to addresses, the <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">MailNotifier</span></tt> uses an <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">EmailLookup</span></tt>
object. This provides a <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">getAddress</span></tt> method which accepts a name and
(eventually) returns an address. The default <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">MailNotifier</span></tt>
module provides an <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">EmailLookup</span></tt> which simply appends a static string,
configurable when the notifier is created. To create more complex behaviors
(perhaps using an LDAP lookup, or using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">finger</span></tt> on a central host to
determine a preferred address for the developer), provide a different object
as the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lookup</span></tt> argument.</p>
<p>If an EmailLookup object isn't given to the MailNotifier, the MailNotifier
will try to find emails through <a class="reference internal" href="#user-objects"><em>User Objects</em></a>. This will work the
same as if an EmailLookup object was used if every user in the Build's
Interested Users list has an email in the database for them. If a user
whose change led to a Build doesn't have an email attribute, that user
will not receive an email. If <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">extraRecipients</span></tt> is given, those users
are still sent mail when the EmailLookup object is not specified.</p>
<p>In the future, when the Problem mechanism has been set up, the Buildbot
will need to send mail to arbitrary Users. It will do this by locating a
<tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">MailNotifier</span></tt>-like object among all the buildmaster's status targets, and
asking it to send messages to various Users. This means the User-to-address
mapping only has to be set up once, in your <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">MailNotifier</span></tt>, and every email
message the buildbot emits will take advantage of it.</p>

provides a status target which can announce the results of each build. It
also provides an interactive interface by responding to online queries
posted in the channel or sent as private messages.</p>
<p>In the future, the buildbot can be configured map User names to IRC
nicknames, to watch for the recent presence of these nicknames, and to
deliver build status messages to the interested parties. Like
<tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">MailNotifier</span></tt> does for email addresses, the <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">IRC</span></tt> object
will have an <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">IRCLookup</span></tt> which is responsible for nicknames. The
mapping can be set up statically, or it can be updated by online users
themselves (by claiming a username with some kind of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">buildbot:</span> <span class="pre">i</span> <span class="pre">am</span>
<span class="pre">user</span> <span class="pre">warner</span></tt> commands).</p>
<p>Once the mapping is established, the rest of the buildbot can ask the
<tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">IRC</span></tt> object to send messages to various users. It can report on
the likelihood that the user saw the given message (based upon how long the
user has been inactive on the channel), which might prompt the Problem

<p>Each build has a set of <em>Build Properties</em>, which can be used by its
build steps to modify their actions.  These properties, in the form of
key-value pairs, provide a general framework for dynamically altering
the behavior of a build based on its circumstances.</p>
<p>Properties form a simple kind of variable in a build.  Some properties are set
when the build starts, and properties can be changed as a build progresses --
properties set or changed in one step may be accessed in subsequent steps.
Property values can be numbers, strings, lists, or dictionaries - basically,
anything that can be represented in JSON.</p>
<p>Properties are very flexible, and can be used to implement all manner
of functionality.  Here are some examples:</p>
<p>Most Source steps record the revision that they checked out in
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">got_revision</span></tt> property.  A later step could use this
property to specify the name of a fully-built tarball, dropped in an
easily-accessible directory for later testing.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">In builds with more than one codebase, the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">got_revision</span></tt> property is a dictionary, keyed by codebase.</p>
</div>
<p>Some projects want to perform nightly builds as well as building in response to
committed changes.  Such a project would run two schedulers, both pointing to
the same set of builders, but could provide an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">is_nightly</span></tt> property so
that steps can distinguish the nightly builds, perhaps to run more
resource-intensive tests.</p>
<p>Some projects have different build processes on different systems.
Rather than create a build factory for each slave, the steps can use
buildslave properties to identify the unique aspects of each slave
and adapt the build process dynamically.</p>

<div class="section" id="multiple-codebase-builds">
<span id="id12"></span><h2>Multiple-Codebase Builds<a class="headerlink" href="#multiple-codebase-builds" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>What if an end-product is composed of code from several codebases?
Changes may arrive from different repositories within the tree-stable-timer period.
Buildbot will not only use the source-trees that contain changes but also needs the remaining source-trees to build the complete product.</p>
<p>For this reason a <a class="reference internal" href="#scheduling-builds"><em>Scheduler</em></a> can be configured to base a build on a set of several source-trees that can (partly) be overridden by the information from incoming <tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">Change</span></tt>s.</p>
<p>As described <a class="reference internal" href="#source-stamps"><em>above</em></a>, the source for each codebase is identified by a source stamp, containing its repository, branch and revision.
A full build set will specify a source stamp set describing the source to use for each codebase.</p>
<p>Configuring all of this takes a coordinated approach.  A complete multiple repository configuration consists of:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p class="first">a <em>codebase generator</em></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Every relevant change arriving from a VC must contain a codebase.
This is done by a <a class="reference internal" href="cfg-global.html#cfg-codebaseGenerator" title="codebaseGenerator"><tt class="xref bb bb-cfg docutils literal"><span class="pre">codebaseGenerator</span></tt></a> that is defined in the configuration.
Most generators examine the repository of a change to determine its codebase, using project-specific rules.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">some <em>schedulers</em></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Each <a class="reference internal" href="cfg-schedulers.html#cfg-schedulers" title="schedulers"><tt class="xref bb bb-cfg docutils literal"><span class="pre">scheduler</span></tt></a> has to be configured with a set of all required <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">codebases</span></tt> to build a product.
These codebases indicate the set of required source-trees.
In order for the scheduler to be able to produce a complete set for each build, the configuration can give a default repository, branch, and revision for each codebase.
When a scheduler must generate a source stamp for a codebase that has received no changes, it applies these default values.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">multiple <em>source steps</em> - one for each codebase</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A <a class="reference internal" href="#builder"><em>Builders</em></a>'s build factory must include a <a class="reference internal" href="cfg-buildsteps.html#source-checkout"><em>source step</em></a> for each codebase.
Each of the source steps has a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">codebase</span></tt> attribute which is used to select an appropriate source stamp from the source stamp set for a build.
This information comes from the arrived changes or from the scheduler's configured default values.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Each <a class="reference internal" href="cfg-buildsteps.html#source-checkout"><em>source step</em></a> has to have its own <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">workdir</span></tt> set in order for the checkout to be done for each codebase in its own directory.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
