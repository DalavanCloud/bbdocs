This repository holds the generated version of buildbot docs.
It also serves as a backup for generated docs for old versions of buildbot.

This is not where the doc is maintained!
The doc is maintained in sphinx format in the main buildbot repository

The 'docs/' directory corresponds to http://docs.buildbot.net/
